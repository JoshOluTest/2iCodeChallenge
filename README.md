Assumption Summary

1.	I’m assuming that the user will enter a sorted array of whole numbers as a comma-separated input.

2.	I’m assume that the user will enter a valid integer for the variable X.


3.	Using input to prompt the user for input and assume that the user will provide valid input. The input is then split by commas to create the array.


4.	The input gathering and the function execution are separated to make the code more modular and readable.
